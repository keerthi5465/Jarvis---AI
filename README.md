### Python Voice Assistant (Shinchan) 

This is a Python-based voice assistant named "Shinchan" that performs various tasks using voice commands. The assistant can greet the user, fetch information from Wikipedia, open websites like YouTube and Google, play music, check the time, and launch applications like Visual Studio Code. The project utilizes several libraries such as `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech, `speech_recognition` for recognizing voice commands, `wikipedia` for fetching summaries, and `webbrowser`/`os` for handling browser and file interactions.
